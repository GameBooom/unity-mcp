# Funplay MCP for Unity

Funplay MCP for Unity is an open-source MCP server for the Unity Editor.

## Getting Started

1. Install via UPM using the Git URL for this repository
2. Open **Funplay > MCP Server**
3. Start the server and use the built-in one-click client configuration
4. Connect your AI client to the endpoint shown in the window (`http://127.0.0.1:8765/` by default)
5. Open **Funplay > Tool Exposure** to edit the exact tools exposed by `core` or `full`
6. For Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex, use **Configure + Skills** or open **Funplay > Project Skills** to install the default `unity-mcp-workflow` skill
7. Open **Funplay > Plugin Settings** to adjust debug logging when troubleshooting
